\title{Shuffle a tidytensor in the first rank.}
\usage{
shuffle(t, seed = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{t}{the tidytensor to apply over.}

\item{seed}{random seed to be used for shuffling.}

\item{...}{unused}
}
\value{
a tidytensor of the same shape.
}
\description{
Shuffle's the entries in the first rank of a tensor. For example, if
\code{x} has shape (3, 5, 5), it may be indexed as \code{x[c(2, 3, 1), , ]}.
It's possible to set a custom seed for repeatable shuffling (amongst tensors with
the same size in the first rank).
}
\details{
Since tidytensor consider tensors as representing hierarchical "set of" relationships,
shuffling in any rank other than the first would permute lower entities across set boundaries
in higher ranks. For example, in a set of color images of shape (500, 28, 28, 3), shuffling the last rank
would re-order the channels, but identically for all the images. See \code{\link{tt_apply}} for applying functions
(such as shuffle) over lower ranks of a tensor.
}
\examples{
# shape [100, 26, 26]
t <- as.tidytensor(array(rnorm(100 * 26 * 26), dim = c(100, 26, 26)))
ranknames(t) <- c("sample", "row", "col")
print(t)

t <- shuffle(t, seed = 42)
